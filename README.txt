This is a qrcode_puzzle_maker that takes a QRcode and returns potential words
that can represent the QRcode in a puzzle

There is limited correction in the program so the QRcode must be straight.
As in test.py, use drawGridLines and turn on trace to better understand the
code, visualize the changes, and ensure the program is properly reading the
QRcode.

See the included word document for a sample puzzle I created and test.py for
sample usage.
