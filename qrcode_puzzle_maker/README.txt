This is a qrcode_puzzle_maker that can be used to analyze a QRcode
and convert it into the necessary words to make a puzzle.

The QRcode must be straight and there is limited correction for different
sizes. Use drawGridLines as in test.py to ensure the program is correctly
detecting edges. If you wanna gain more understanding of the code, turn
on trace as in test.py.

See my sample puzzle I created with this program in the word
document entitled QRcodepuzzle
